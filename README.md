# Pizza_Sales_Dashboard_Using_PowerBI
This project is a comprehensive business intelligence solution designed to analyze and visualize a pizza business's sales data. Using SQL for data handling and Power BI for visualization, the goal is to provide clear, actionable insights that can help a business make data-driven decisions. The result is a dynamic dashboard that simplifies complex sales data, making it easy for anyone to understand key performance indicators and spot trends.

Key Features and Insights
The dashboard is built to give a complete picture of the business's performance. It features a high-level summary of key metrics and a detailed breakdown of product performance.

Overall Sales Performance: The main dashboard provides a snapshot of the business's health. It prominently displays key performance indicators (KPIs) like:

Total Revenue ($817.86K)

Total Pizzas Sold (49,574)

Total Orders (21,350)

Average Order Value (AOV) ($38.31)

Average Pizzas per Order (2.32)

Sales Trends: Visualizations clearly show sales patterns over time. The "Daily Trend of Total Orders" highlights that orders are highest on Fridays and Saturdays, while the "Monthly Trend" indicates sales peak in January and July.

Product and Category Analysis: The dashboard offers deep insights into what is selling and what isn't.

Category Contribution: The "Classic" and "Supreme" categories are the biggest contributors to total sales.

Size Performance: The majority of the revenue (75%) comes from Large and Medium-sized pizzas, a key finding for managing inventory and pricing.

Best and Worst Sellers: A dedicated section ranks pizzas based on their performance across different metrics:

Top Performers: "The Thai Chicken Pizza" leads in revenue, while "The Classic Deluxe Pizza" is the best seller by quantity and total orders.

Bottom Performers: "The Brie Carre Pizza" is identified as the lowest performer across all key metrics, providing a clear signal for potential menu changes or promotions.

Technology Stack

SQL: Used for cleaning, transforming, and analyzing the raw sales data.

Power BI: Utilized for building the interactive and visually appealing dashboards.

This project demonstrates skills in data analysis, data visualization, and business intelligence, turning raw data into valuable business insights.
